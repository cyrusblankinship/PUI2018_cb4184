### Time Series Analysis & Random Forest Classifiers

**Notes:** All work was done alone.

## Assignment 1: MTA Weekly Card Swipe Data from 05/21/2010 - 194 weeks
The data source was a 3D Numpy Array (MTAfares.pny) of shape 600,23,194 and corresponded to the number of swipes for a 194 week period, per card. This assignment was broken into 3 parts. type (23), per station (600).
1. Investigate which week was an outlier (fell more than 3 standard deviations below mean)
2. What card types had the steepest increase and decrease over the given time series?
3. Build two Random Forest Classifiers to predict card type, given (1.) 4 engineered features & (2.) the entire time series.

## Assignment 2: Improve plot from HW8
