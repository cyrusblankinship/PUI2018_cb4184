# Homework 10 - cb4184

* I worked alone on this homework other than the error calculation in assignment 2. Sam Burns helped me with the formula since he had spoken to Ilyas. 



## Assignment 1
This was an extension of Lab 9 in which we used Ascombe's Quartet for linear models. We then compared the goodness of fit between each pair of nested models using LR Ratio Testing, both from the built in function and by scratch

## Assignment 2
This was an applied project using linear regression techniques on Local Law 84 data. It included the following
* Using log scaling to plot our exogenous and endogenous variables (in order to limit the impact of outliers)
* Using regression models to determine which should be our exogenous vs endogenous variable
* Defining and calculating errors for Poisson statistics
* Calculating our chi-square statistic by hand, including errors
* Running LR test to see which is better, quadratic model vs simple linear model.
